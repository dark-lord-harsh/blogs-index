> A personal index of all my Hashnode articles, maintained in a single place.

## About

This repository contains **only this README.md** and serves as a central, long-term index of all the articles I have written on **Hashnode**.

Instead of relying on platform search or bookmarks, I use this file as a simple, version-controlled list of my writing—easy to update, easy to share, and easy to revisit.

## Articles

_All articles listed below are written by me and published on Hashnode._
  - [Why Version Control Exists: The Pendrive Problem](https://dev.to/dark-lord-harsh/why-version-control-exists-the-pendrive-problem-every-developer-faced-1h0d)
  - [Git for Beginners: Basics and Essential Commands]()
  - [Inside Git: How It Works and the Role of the .git Folder]()
## Organization

Articles can optionally be grouped by:
- Topic
- Series
- Year
- Difficulty level

(Structure may evolve as more articles are added.)

## Usage

- Single source of truth for my Hashnode writing
- Quick reference for sharing my work
- Lightweight archive with no extra files
